1. Cloning
1.1- Go to project's first page in GitHub (Our project is "Group20_GitGithub_Practice")
        -> Put the Link here
1.2- Find "Code" and click on it
1.3- Copy the URL of the project, you can click the copy icon just right of the Url.
1.4- Go to your intelliJ
1.5- Click on File -> New -> Project from Version Control
1.6- Paste the URL there and clone it.

2. Go to your Intellij and create a new branch (branch name can be your name like MattReader)
 from the Local master and check out then work on the your branch,
3. Create a Feature with your name package under src (FeatureMatt)
4. Create a *class with your username under src->test->java (not under main, under the test)(TestMatt)
Do some *Commits as print out what you would like, i.e;

public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello my friends");					//Commit
        System.out.println("Good luck with the new project");	                //Commit
        System.out.println("Success to everyone");				//Commit
    }

(There is a short video how to do it, it is better to see it)
